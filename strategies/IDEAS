BUY: LEARNED / STATISTIC VALUE.
    LET's say learned VALUE
    Stop loss: some risk value away from learned value

    so let's say when we receive a Zigtop, 
        we place a buy order at say 0.95 * zigtop_high
        and place a stop loss at 0.91 of zigtop_high 

    we then place a sell order of 1.02 of when we receive
        ziglow_low/ close?

Why don't we get the specific price at which a zigzag is certified and use that price as a a point of referral 
of the actual profitability of this strategy.

    we could print "zigzag, price of verification (which will be the current price the market is at), sign"
    done

Why not use the point where zigzagvalue[0] is different from zigzagvalue[-1]
    \: no because it will happen at highs and lows
    so what if we  added a new line to zigzags.py that will only be true when there is an 
    agreement of a change in zigzags? And then used it 
        we could print the price at such lines and see if they reflecet the price 
        we see 


EXIT:
    Put a sell order when you receive the late buy signal 
    20% trailing when you receive buy signal
    10% when price has moved 1.02 above low
    7% when price moves 1.04 above low
    5% when price moves 1.05 above low
    2% when price moves 1.06 above low


THINK: of the starting point from which price deviates 1.06, 0.93 
                    X
                          ->1.06
                      0.97<-         
                    --->
            <---
    continuously
