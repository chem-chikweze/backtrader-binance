BUY: LEARNED / STATISTIC VALUE.
    LET's say learned VALUE
    Stop loss: some risk value away from learned value

    so let's say when we receive a Zigtop, 
        we place a buy order at say 0.95 * zigtop_high
        and place a stop loss at 0.91 of zigtop_high 

    we then place a sell order of 1.02 of when we receive
        ziglow_low/ close?
